# CSS Specificity Gotcha

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked issue in CSS: the impact of specificity on style application. Even though rules are often written sequentially in a stylesheet, CSS specificity dictates which style actually gets applied based on the selector's type and complexity.

The `bug.css` file contains code that highlights this.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a strategy for resolving this issue.  More explanation can be found in the files themselves.

This example showcases how understanding CSS specificity can be crucial for debugging and maintaining clean CSS code.
