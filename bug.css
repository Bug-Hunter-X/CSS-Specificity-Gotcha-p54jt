The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `#id` selector has higher specificity than the `p` selector, so the `color: red;` rule from the `p` selector is overridden by the `color: blue;` rule from the `#id` selector, even though it is declared later. This behavior can be unexpected if you assume CSS rules are processed in the order they appear in the stylesheet. 

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

#myParagraph {
  color: blue;
}

```
