There are several ways to solve this depending on the desired outcome. To ensure that `#myParagraph` is styled with red, one could apply the `!important` flag. However, this should be avoided as it reduces maintainability. 
Another method could be to restructure selectors and their specificity. 

One solution is to ensure that the higher specificity rule is defined last, or to structure the CSS in a way where selector specificity is not a problem. 

Here's an example:

```css
/* solution 1: order of definition */
#myParagraph {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}

/* solution 2: adjusting the selector */
#myParagraph.special {
  color: red;
}

```

Remember, always prioritize writing clean and well-structured CSS to avoid such specificity issues.
